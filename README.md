# Rack::ECG

[![Gem version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/rack-ecg)][gem-page] [![Rubydoc](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-rubydoc-success)][rubydoc]

Rack middleware for Ruby web apps, providing a simple and extensible health
check endpoint, with minimal configuration.

> Electrocardiogram (ECG): A recording of the electrical activity of the heart.

## Features

- Start with a single line in your `config.ru` or `config/application.rb` file.
- reports git revision status
- reports ActiveRecord migration schema version
- reports errors if any check can't be executed for whatever reason
- JSON output

## Development Status

[![Build Status](https://github.com/envato/rack-ecg/workflows/test/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/envato/rack-ecg/actions?query=branch%3Amain)

`Rack::ECG` is extracted from production code in use at
[Envato](http://envato.com). However, it is undergoing early development, and
APIs and features are almost certain to be in flux.

## Getting Started

Add this to your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'rack-ecg', '~> 0.2.0`
```

Then run `bundle install`.

In Rails you can add `Rack::ECG` to your `config/application.rb` as a middleware:

```ruby
# config/application.rb
# ...
config.middleware.use Rack::ECG
# ...
```

In Rack apps, you can add `Rack::ECG` to your `config.ru`:

```ruby
# config.ru
require 'rack/ecg'

use Rack::ECG

run MyRackApp
```

## Usage

You can now hit your app and get a basic health check response from `Rack::ECG`

```
$ curl http://localhost:9292/_ecg
{
  "http": {
    "status": "ok",
    "value": "online"
  }
}
```

`/_ecg` will return a `200` HTTP status if all the checks are OK, or `500`
status if any of the checks fail.


## Configuration

There are options that can be passed to `use Rack::ECG` to customise how it works.

### Checks

By default, `Rack::ECG` indicates that the service is reponsive via a `http` check. Additional checks are included in this gem, and can be enabled by passing their configuration to the `checks` parameter. To enable a check, add its name, and optionally configuration, to the `checks` array:

```ruby
use Rack::ECG, checks: [
  # no configuration required, or allowed
  :http,
  # passing configuration options
  [:static, { name: "app", value: "my-cool-app" }],
  # some checks can be used multiple times
  [:static, { name: "env", value: Rails.env }],
]
```

#### `active_record`

Requires a configured ActiveRecord connection. Does not support configuration. Indicates whether the connection to the default database is currently open. On success, returns something in the following format:

```json
{
  "active_record": {
    "status": "ok",
    "value": true
  }
}
```

#### `error`

Does not support configuration. Always returns the following:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "status": "error",
    "value": "PC LOAD ERROR"
  }
}
```

#### `git_revision`

**Deprecated**: will be removed in version 1.0.0. [See the GitRevision Check Replacement example](./examples/git_revision_check_replacement.ru), which uses the `static` check to memoize the value.

Requires the `git` executable on path, and that the application's working directory is within a Git repository. Does not support configuration. On success, returns something in the following format:

```json
{
  "git_revision": {
    "status": "ok",
    "value": "dc840f9d5563e6e5a8b34da29c298764e3046039"
  }
}
```

#### `http`

Automatically included, and does not support configuration. Always returns the following:

```json
{
  "http": {
    "status": "ok",
    "value": "online"
  }
}
```

#### `migration_version`

Requires a configured ActiveRecord connection, and that ActiveRecord migrations are in use. Does not support configuration. Queries the `schema_versions` table on the default database to report the current migration version. On success, returns something in the following format:

```json
{
  "migration_version": {
    "status": "ok",
    "value": "20210506024055"
  }
}
```

#### `redis`

Requires the Redis gem. Requires configuration, an instance of a Redis client. Indicates whether the Redis client passed in is currently connected to the Redis database. On success, returns something in the following format:

```json
{
  "redis": {
    "status": "ok",
    "value": true
  }
}
```

#### `sequel`

Requires the Sequel gem. Requires configuration, and can be configured multiple times. Indicates whether a (new) connection can be established to the configured Sequel database.

Given the following configuration:

```ruby
{
  connection: "sqlite://events.db",
  name: "events", # must be unique per sequel check
}
```

Returns the something in the following format on success:

```json
{
  "sequel_events": {
    "status": "ok",
    "value": true
  }
}
```

#### `static`

Returns the same value every time. Requires configuration, and can be configured multiple times.

Given the following configuration:

```ruby
{
  name: "image_build_url",               # must be unique per static check
  success: true,                         # default value
  status: Rack::ECG::Check::Status::OK,  # optional, overrides `success`
  value: ENV["IMAGE_BUILD_URL"], 
}
```

Returns the something in the following format:

```json
{
  "image_build_url": {
    "status": "ok",
    "value": "https://example.com/pipelines/my-cool-app/builds/1234"
  }
}
```

### `at`

By default `Rack::ECG` is mapped to a URL of `/_ecg`, you can set this to
a different path by setting the `at` option. e.g.

```ruby
use Rack::ECG, at: "/health_check"
```

### `hook`

The `hook` option takes a `Proc` or equivalent, and calls it after the checks
have run, but before the response is complete.

```ruby
use Rack::ECG, hook: Proc.new { |success, _checks| puts "Is healthy? #{success}" }
```

- `success`: whether the response will indicate success
- `checks`: an array of the check names and values

More examples are provided in [/examples](https://github.com/envato/rack-ecg/tree/main/examples)

## Requirements

- Ruby >= 2.6
- Rack
- To use optional `git_revision` check, your deployed code needs to be in a git repo, and
`git` command must be accessible on the server
- To use optional `migration_version` check, you must be using ActiveRecord and
migrations stored in `schema_versions` table
