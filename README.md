# Rack::ECG

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/envato/rack-ecg](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/envato/rack-ecg?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

An easy to configure Rack middleware for Ruby web apps to provide a simple
health check endpoint that tells you vital life signs about your app. All
without the boilerplate service checking code you've written 10 times before.

(it's ECG as in electrocardiogram - as in the machine that monitors how your
heart works)

## Features
- simple 1 line to drop into your `config.ru` or `config/application.rb` file to
  set up
- reports git revision status
- reports ActiveRecord migration schema version
- reports errors if any check can't be executed for whatever reason
- JSON output

## Development Status [![travis ci build](https://api.travis-ci.org/envato/rack-ecg.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/envato/rack-ecg)

`Rack::ECG` is extracted from production code in use at
[Envato](http://envato.com). However, it is undergoing early development, and
APIs and features are almost certain to be in flux.

## Getting Started

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rack-ecg'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rack-ecg

### Rails

In Rails you can add `Rack::ECG` to your `config/application.rb` as a middleware

```ruby
# config/application.rb
# ...
config.middleware.use Rack::ECG
# ...
```

### Rack

In Rack apps, you can add `Rack::ECG` to your `config.ru`

```ruby
# config.ru
require 'rack/ecg'

use Rack::ECG

run MyRackApp
```

You can now hit your app and get a basic health check response from `Rack::ECG`

```
$ curl http://localhost:9292/_ecg
{
  "http": {
    "status": "ok",
    "value": "online"
  }
}
```

`/_ecg` will return a `200` HTTP status if all the checks are OK, or `500`
status if any of the checks fail.


## Configuration

There are options that can be passed to `use Rack::ECG` to customise how it
works.

### `checks` 
Out of the box `Rack::ECG` doesn't do much and just checks that
HTTP responses can be returned. There are a number of built in checks that
`Rack::ECG` can be told to do (more to come)
- `:git_revision` - this assumes your code is deployed via git and exists in a
  git repo, and that the `git` command can access it
- `:migration_version` - this assumes you are using ActiveRecord migrations. It
  queries the `schema_versions` table and tells you what version the database is
at.

So using `git_revision` and `migration_version` would look like:

```ruby
use Rack::ECG, checks: [:git_revision, :migration_version]
```

```
$ curl http://localhost:9292/_ecg
{
  "http": {
    "status": "ok",
    "value": "online"
  },
  "git_revision": {
    "status": "ok",
    "value": "fb16e2c3b88af671c42880e6977bba34d7b05ba6\n"
  },
  "migration_version": {
    "status": "ok",
    "value": "20150319050250"
  }
}
```

### `at` 

By default `Rack::ECG` is mapped to a URL of `/_ecg`, you can set this to
a different path by setting the `at` option. e.g.

```ruby
use Rack::ECG, at: "/health_check"
```
## Requirements
- Developed and tested on Ruby 2.2.1. Probably works on Ruby 1.9.3, but not
verified
- Rack
- To use optional `git_revision` check, your deployed code needs to be in a git repo, and
`git` command must be accessible on the server
- To use optional `migration_version` check, you must be using ActiveRecord and
migrations stored in `schema_versions` table
